            Samuel Oak, one of the most renowned Pokémon Researchers, started off his journey as a psuedo-Trainer/Watcher. 
            Collecting Pokémon for battling but also sketching them. 
            When he was about 10, he rescued an injured Celebi from a Hunter and accidentlaly travelled forwards in time and met with Ash. 
            He & Ash defended Celebi and eventually Sammy got sent back in time and continued his life. 
            After giving up being a Watcher, he started to become a Pokémon Researcher and started a family, where his grandson now follows in his footsteps. 
            Oak can sometimes be a bit forgetful, but is always knowledgable of things Pokémon. 
            He likes making Haikus and that sometimes takes over what he is trying to do.
